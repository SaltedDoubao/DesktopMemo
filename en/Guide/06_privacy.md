# Privacy & Security

## Data Storage

DesktopMemo stores data locally in the `.memodata` directory by default and does not proactively upload to the network.

## Logging

The application records runtime logs in `.memodata/.logs/` for troubleshooting purposes. If you need to attach logs when submitting an Issue, please check for personal information and redact as necessary.

## Cloud Sync (Planned)

If cloud sync (e.g., MySQL cloud storage) is enabled in the future, it will follow the principles of "local-first, optional sync, explicit conflict resolution, privacy protection." See [MySQL Integration Specification](../mysql-integration.md) for details.
