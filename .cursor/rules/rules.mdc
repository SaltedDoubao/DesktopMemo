## Always respond in Chinese-simplified

## If there are any summary documents, please store them in the `.local/` directory

## Use GPT-5 make plan, Sonnet 4.5 programming, Grok 4 do web search

## Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation.  This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

## Before running `dotnet build`, you must first delete the artifacts/ directory for the corresponding version number (for example, if the current version is 2.0.0, delete artifacts/v2.0.0/)
