## Key Concepts Overview

- DesktopMemo focuses on "Memos (Markdown) + Todo items."
- Data is stored by default in the `/.memodata` directory under the application folder (see [Data & Backup](04_data-backup.md)).
- Starting from v2.3.0, a local SQLite database is gradually introduced to improve performance and consistency (Markdown content files are still retained).
